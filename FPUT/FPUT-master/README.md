# FPUT

An exploration of the non-linear 1-dimensional oscillator explored by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou (FPUT) at Maniac I
many years ago. I wanted to test the limits of symplectic integration versus higher order integrators. I have Runge-Kutta 4th
order, 2nd order symplectic (leapfrog/midpoint) and 4th order symplectic (Ruth-Forest).

I highly recommend a paper by Yoshida Haruo on deriving the Symplectic coefficients from 1992

NB I think these are the old versions so if you run and there's errors just let me know
